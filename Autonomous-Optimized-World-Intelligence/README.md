# Autonomous-Optimized-World-Intelligence

Welcome to **Autonomous‑Optimized‑World‑Intelligence (A.O.W.I.)**, the master kernel powering all of the A.O.W.I. trading, prediction and automation engines.

This repository centralises the core logic and shared components used across multiple sub‑projects, including scalping bots, high‑frequency trading strategies, liquidity sweeps and predictive modules.  It provides a unified architecture for:

- **Core engine:** foundational algorithms for order‑flow analysis, volatility modelling and dynamic risk management.
- **Modules:** pluggable strategy components such as ultra‑scalp, liquidity sweep, VWAP magnet and risk‑reversion engines.
- **Deployment:** templates for deploying to MetaTrader5, Replit, n8n and other environments.
- **Documentation:** living docs and diagrams explaining architecture, configuration and performance metrics.

## Getting started

This project is under active development.  To start contributing or integrating with your own trading infrastructure, see the following sections:

1. **Installation:** clone the repository and install dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt` (to be defined for each module).
2. **Configuration:** explore the `config/` directory for JSON/YAML files that define risk profiles, session maps, TP/SL schema and other parameters.
3. **Running strategies:** each module in `modules/` exposes an entry point for its particular strategy.  Consult the docs in `docs/` for details.
4. **Deployment:** use the templates in `deploy/` to run the core engine and modules in your chosen environment.
