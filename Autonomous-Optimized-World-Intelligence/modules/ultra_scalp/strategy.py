Ultra Scalping Strategy Module
--------------------------------

This module contains a placeholder implementation for an ultra‑scalping strategy.  In a real
deployment, this would include logic to monitor market tick data, compute indicators (e.g.
moving averages, VWAP) and place trades based on momentum and liquidity conditions.

For now, it simply prints a message when run to demonstrate the structure.
