Liquidity Sweep Strategy Module
-------------------------------

This module contains a placeholder implementation for a liquidity sweep strategy.  Such a
strategy monitors market depth and order book imbalances to detect and exploit spikes in
liquidity.  It may also interact with multiple venues or symbols.

For now, it simply prints a message when run.
