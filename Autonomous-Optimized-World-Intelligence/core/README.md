# Core

This directory houses the foundational algorithms and shared utilities for the A.O.W.I. ecosystem.  Key components may include:

- Orderâ€‘flow analysis functions.
- Volatility and momentum models.
- Risk management utilities (e.g. ATR calculations, dynamic stop loss algorithms).
- Common data structures and helper functions used across modules.

Each submodule within this directory should have its own README describing its purpose and usage.
