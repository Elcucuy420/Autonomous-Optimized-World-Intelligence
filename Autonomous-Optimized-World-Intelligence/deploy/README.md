# Deployment

The deployment directory contains templates and scripts for running the A.O.W.I. engine and modules in various environments, such as:

- **MetaTrader5 (MT5) integration** using the MetaTrader5 Python API.
- **Replit** hosted scripts for persistent bot operation.
- **n8n** workflows for eventâ€‘driven trading automation.
- **Docker** files for containerized deployment.

Each subdirectory should include documentation explaining how to set up the environment and launch the engine.
